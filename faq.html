              Straightforward answers to the questions we hear most often about working with Travel by B &amp; T.

          <div class="tb-card">
            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Do you charge planning fees?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              For most cruise and all-inclusive resort bookings, we do not charge a separate planning fee. We are typically
              compensated by the travel supplier. For complex, highly customized itineraries (for example, multi-country
              Europe trips with many moving parts), a planning retainer may apply. If that’s the case, we will explain it
              clearly before any work begins.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">What types of trips do you book?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We focus on:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Ocean cruises (Caribbean, Bahamas, Europe, Mediterranean, and more)</li>
              <li>All-inclusive resort stays</li>
              <li>Europe and Mediterranean itineraries</li>
              <li>Group and celebration travel</li>
              <li>Short getaways and longer “big” trips</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">Can you help with flights?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Yes, we can assist with flight options as part of a broader cruise, resort, or itinerary planning process. We’ll
              discuss what makes sense based on your preferences, schedule, and budget.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">Do I have to live in Virginia to work with you?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              No. While we are based in Ridgeway, Virginia and serve Henry County and surrounding communities, we work with
              clients in other areas as well. Most planning can be handled by email, text, and phone.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">How far in advance should I start planning?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              It depends on the trip:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Popular cruises and peak-season travel: 9–18 months in advance is ideal.</li>
              <li>Standard cruises and resorts: 6–12 months is usually comfortable.</li>
              <li>Last-minute getaways: We can look at options, but flexibility helps.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">Do you book group trips?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Yes. We can assist with family reunions, friends’ trips, milestone celebrations, and group cruises. We help
              coordinate the logistics, communicate key information, and work with the supplier on group details.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">Do I need travel insurance?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We strongly recommend reviewing travel insurance options for most trips, especially those involving flights,
              cruises, or non-refundable components. Unexpected events, medical needs, weather, and delays can be costly.
              We can provide information and quotes from insurance providers so you can make an informed decision.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">What documents will I need?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Requirements vary by trip. Common items include:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Valid government-issued photo ID (and in many cases, a passport)</li>
              <li>Passport with sufficient validity beyond your travel dates for international trips</li>
              <li>Any visas or entry requirements for your destinations</li>
              <li>Supplier confirmation documents and boarding passes</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We will help point you to official resources for passport, REAL ID, and other requirements.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">What happens if my flight or cruise is delayed or changed?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We will help you understand your options and, where appropriate, work with the supplier on your behalf.
              Ultimately, changes and compensation decisions are made by the airlines, cruise lines, and other providers,
              but you won’t be navigating the situation alone.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">How do we communicate during the planning process?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We use a mix of email, text, and phone based on your preference and the complexity of the trip. You will
              always know how to reach us with questions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">How do I get started?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
