            <h1 class="tb-section-title">Answers to Common Travel Questions</h1>
            <p class="tb-section-lead">
              We’ve gathered the most common questions clients ask when planning trips, cruises, and 
              all-inclusive travel through Travel by B &amp; T.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="tb-card">

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Do you charge any planning fees?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              For most trips — including cruises and all-inclusive resorts — we do not charge planning fees.  
              Certain highly customized or complex itineraries involving multiple destinations, rail, or 
              in-country transfers may require a planning retainer. We’ll always tell you upfront.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Why should I use a travel advisor instead of booking myself?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Advisors simplify the process, research options for you, manage documents, communicate with 
              suppliers, and support you before, during, and after travel — at no extra cost for most bookings.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Do you work with all cruise lines?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We book all major ocean cruise lines including Royal Caribbean, Carnival, MSC, Celebrity, Norwegian, 
              Princess, and more — along with river cruise options depending on destination and availability.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">What information do you need to start planning?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Basic details like travel dates, number of travelers, destination preferences, budget range, 
              and any must-haves help us curate a tailored list of options.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">What forms of payment are accepted?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              All payments are made securely through the travel supplier (cruise line, resort, airline).  
              We never store or directly process your payment.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">What documents do I need for a cruise?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              A valid passport is recommended. Some closed-loop Caribbean cruises allow birth certificate + 
              government-issued ID, but restrictions apply — and passports are always safer.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">How do I protect my trip?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Travel insurance is highly recommended and protects against cancellations, delays, medical 
              emergencies, and more.

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Do you help with group travel?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Absolutely — from family reunions to birthday trips to large group cruises. We handle the 
              coordination, deadlines, and communications.

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Can you help if something goes wrong during travel?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Yes. If a delay, cancellation, or itinerary issue happens, we support you and work with the 
              supplier to navigate options or adjustments.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">How do I get started?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              The easiest way is our inquiry form — low pressure, quick, and gives us what we need to begin.
