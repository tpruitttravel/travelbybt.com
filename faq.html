              Straightforward answers to the questions we hear most often about working with Travel by B &amp; T.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="tb-card">
            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Do you charge planning fees?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              For most cruise and all-inclusive resort bookings, we do not charge a separate planning fee. We are typically
              compensated by the travel supplier. For complex, highly customized itineraries (for example, multi-country
              Europe trips with many moving parts), a planning retainer may apply. If that’s the case, we will explain it
              clearly before any work begins so you can decide how you’d like to proceed.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">What types of trips do you book?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We focus on:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Ocean cruises (Caribbean, Bahamas, Europe, Mediterranean, and more)</li>
              <li>All-inclusive resort stays</li>
              <li>Europe and Mediterranean itineraries</li>
              <li>Group and celebration travel</li>
              <li>Short getaways and longer “big” trips</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">Can you help with flights?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Yes. For many trips, we can help review flight options as part of the overall planning process. We look at
              schedule, connections, and practicality, especially when timing matters for cruise embarkation or tight
              connections. Ultimately, flight availability and pricing are controlled by the airlines.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">Do I have to live in Virginia to work with you?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              No. While we are based in Ridgeway, Virginia and serve Henry County and surrounding communities, we also work
              with clients in other areas. Most planning is handled via email, text, and phone.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">How far in advance should I start planning?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              It depends on the trip:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Popular cruises and peak-season travel: ideally 9–18 months ahead</li>
              <li>Standard cruises and resorts: 6–12 months is usually comfortable</li>
              <li>Last-minute getaways: we can still look at options, but flexibility helps a lot</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">What happens if my flight or cruise is delayed or changed?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Delays and schedule changes are part of modern travel. When they happen, we help you understand your options
              and what your Supplier (airline, cruise line, resort, or tour operator) is offering. We can assist with:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Clarifying what the Supplier is proposing or requiring</li>
              <li>Helping you evaluate alternatives (rebooking, new routes, etc.)</li>
              <li>Pointing you to the correct contact or portal when action is required quickly</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Final decisions and compensation are made by the Suppliers, but you are not left to interpret everything alone.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">How quickly do you typically respond?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              For standard questions during normal hours, we aim to respond as promptly as possible, generally within one
              business day. For time-sensitive travel issues, we do our best to prioritize and respond quickly based on
              the nature of the situation and the timing of your departure or current travel.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">Do I need travel insurance?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We strongly recommend reviewing travel insurance options for most trips, especially those involving flights,
              cruises, or non-refundable components. Unexpected events, medical needs, weather, and delays can be costly.
              We can provide information and quotes from insurance providers so you can make an informed decision based on
              your risk tolerance and budget.
            </p>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              You can read more on our <a href="/travel-insurance.html">Travel Insurance</a> page.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">What documents will I need?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Requirements vary by trip. Common items include:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Valid government-issued photo ID (and in many cases, a passport)</li>
              <li>Passport with sufficient validity beyond your travel dates for international trips</li>
              <li>Any visas or entry requirements for your destinations</li>
              <li>Supplier confirmation documents and boarding passes</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We will help point you to official resources for passport, REAL ID, and other requirements, but you are
              responsible for confirming and meeting all entry and documentation requirements.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">Do you shop for the “cheapest deal” or the best fit?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We look for value, not just the lowest price. That means balancing cost with schedule, cabin or room type,
              inclusions, cancellation terms, and your comfort level. Sometimes a slightly higher price provides a much
              better experience or more flexible terms. We’ll walk you through the trade-offs so you can decide what
              matters most.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">Do you book group trips?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Yes. We plan family reunions, friends’ trips, milestone celebrations, and other group travel. We help:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Secure group space with cruise lines and resorts</li>
              <li>Communicate key dates and payment deadlines</li>
              <li>Support individual travelers within the group so the organizer isn’t managing everything alone</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Learn more on our <a href="/group-travel.html">Group Travel</a> page.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">How do we communicate during the planning process?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We use a mix of email, text, and phone based on your preferences and the complexity of the trip. You will
              always know how to reach us with questions, and you’ll know what step of the process you’re in.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">How do I get started?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              You can complete our trip inquiry form on the <a href="/contact.html">Contact</a> page, or reach out directly:
