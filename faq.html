            <h1 class="tb-section-title">Answers to the Most Common Travel Questions</h1>
            <p class="tb-section-lead">
              Here are clear, straightforward answers to help you understand how we work, what to expect,
              and how to prepare for your trip.
            </p>

          <div class="tb-card">

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Do you charge any planning fees?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Most of our services are provided at no additional cost to you. We are compensated by travel suppliers
              for the trips we book. In rare cases—such as highly complex custom itineraries—we may charge a small
              planning fee, which will always be discussed upfront.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Do I pay you directly for my trip?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              No. All payments are made directly to the travel supplier (cruise line, resort, tour operator, etc.)
              using secure, industry-standard payment systems. We do not store or process credit card information.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Why should I book through a travel advisor?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              You get personal support, expertise, Supplier relationships through Gateway Travel, help before/during/
              after travel, and access to exclusive promotions—at no extra cost to you.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Do prices cost more when using a travel agent?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              No. You pay the same price as booking direct—and sometimes less—thanks to special promotions, group rates,
              and supplier relationships.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Can you help if something goes wrong during travel?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Absolutely. We advocate for you with the Supplier, assist with disruptions, and help navigate unexpected travel issues.
              Travel insurance is strongly recommended for added protection.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Do I need a passport for a cruise?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              For most U.S. round-trip “closed-loop” cruises, a passport is not required, but it is still strongly recommended.
              International cruises require a valid passport. We will guide you based on your exact itinerary.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">What information do you need to book my trip?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We typically need legal names, dates of birth, contact info, cabin/room preferences, and any travel requirements
              (mobility needs, celebrating an event, dietary requests, etc.).
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">Do you arrange flights too?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Yes — we can research and book flights, especially when part of a cruise package or bundled itinerary.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">What are your business hours?</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We operate with flexible scheduling to accommodate client needs. You may contact us anytime by email or phone,
              and we will respond promptly.
            </p>
