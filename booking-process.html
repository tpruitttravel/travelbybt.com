            <p class="tb-section-lead">
              We keep your vacation planning simple, transparent, and stress-free—from your first message
              to the moment you’re back home with photos and stories.
            </p>

              Whether you’re booking a cruise, an all-inclusive resort, a Europe itinerary, or a group celebration trip,
              the process is the same. Here’s exactly what to expect when you work with Travel by B &amp; T.

              <h3 class="tb-subheading">1. Connect</h3>
              <p class="tb-muted">
                It starts with a quick connection. You can complete our trip inquiry form, email, text,
                or message us on Facebook. We’ll gather your dates, destination ideas, budget, and any
                must-haves or deal-breakers.
              </p>
              <p class="tb-muted">
                This isn’t a sales pitch—it’s a conversation to understand what a successful trip looks
                like for you.
              </p>

              <h3 class="tb-subheading">2. Curate</h3>
              <p class="tb-muted">
                Using your preferences, we research and build curated options that actually fit what you
                asked for—no giant list of random links.
              </p>
              <p class="tb-muted">
                We’ll walk through pros and cons, important fine print, payment schedules, and deadlines
                so there are no surprises later.
              </p>

              <h3 class="tb-subheading">3. Confirm &amp; Go</h3>
              <p class="tb-muted">
                Once you choose your favorite option, we handle the booking and confirmations—cabins or
                rooms, transfers (where applicable), and key details.
              </p>
              <p class="tb-muted">
                You’ll receive clear documentation and reminders before you travel. If something comes up
                before or during your trip, you reach out to us—not a random call center.

              <p class="tb-muted">
                We keep you updated as we research options, place holds, and finalize reservations.
                You’ll know what we’re waiting on and what’s coming next.
              </p>

              <h3 class="tb-subheading">Transparency</h3>
              <p class="tb-muted">
                In many cases, our services are built into the supplier pricing, so you’re not paying
                more than booking direct. If a planning fee is needed for highly complex itineraries,
                we’ll discuss that up front before any work begins.

              <h3 class="tb-subheading">Support</h3>
              <p class="tb-muted">
                From first quote to final boarding, we act as your advocate. We leverage our partnership
                with Gateway Travel and preferred suppliers to help keep things on track—and assist when
                they don’t go as planned.
              </p>

              <h3 class="tb-subheading">Flexibility</h3>
              <p class="tb-muted">
                Not ready to book yet? That’s fine. You can start the planning process to understand
                options and pricing, then move forward when the timing and budget are right.
