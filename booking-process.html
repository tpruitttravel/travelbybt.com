      <h2>The Three-Step Planning Experience</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Whether you’re booking a cruise, an all-inclusive resort, or a custom Europe itinerary,
        we keep the experience straightforward and stress-free. Here’s exactly what to expect
        when you work with Travel by B &amp; T.
      </p>

      <div class="process-grid">

        <!-- STEP 1 -->
        <article class="process-card">
          <div class="process-step-number">1</div>
          <h3>Connect</h3>
          <p>
            It starts with a quick connection. You can complete our trip inquiry form, text, email,
            or message us on Facebook. We’ll ask about your dates, budget, travel style, and any
            “must-haves” or “absolutely-nots” so we understand what success looks like for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn’t a sales pitch—it’s a conversation. You’re never locked into booking just
            because we talk through options.
          </p>

        <!-- STEP 2 -->
        <article class="process-card">
          <div class="process-step-number">2</div>
          <h3>Curate</h3>
          <p>
            Using your preferences, we research and build curated recommendations—cruise itineraries,
            resorts, or custom routes that actually fit what you asked for. No giant list of random
            links, no pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ll walk you through pros and cons, important fine print, payment schedules, and any
            deadlines so there are no surprises later.
          </p>
        </article>

        <!-- STEP 3 -->
        <article class="process-card">
          <div class="process-step-number">3</div>
          <h3>Confirm &amp; Go</h3>
          <p>
            Once you choose your favorite option, we handle the booking, confirmations, and key
            details—cabins or rooms, transfers, add-ons, and more. You’ll receive clear
            documentation and reminders as important dates approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            If something comes up before or during your trip, you’re not stuck with a call center.
            You reach out to us, and we help you navigate it.

          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>
            We’ll keep you updated as we research options, place holds, and finalize reservations.
            You’ll always know what we’re waiting on and what’s coming next.
          </p>

          <h3>Transparency</h3>
          <p>
            In many cases, our services are built into the supplier pricing, so you’re not paying
            more than booking direct. If a planning fee applies for complex itineraries, we’ll talk
            about it up front before any work begins.

          <h3>Support</h3>
          <p>
            From the first conversation until you’re back home, Travel by B &amp; T is your advocate.
            We leverage our partnership with Gateway Travel and preferred suppliers to help keep
            things on track—and assist when they don’t go as planned.
          </p>

          <h3>Flexibility</h3>
          <p>
            Not ready to book yet? No problem. You can start the process early to understand options
            and pricing, then move forward when the timing is right.
