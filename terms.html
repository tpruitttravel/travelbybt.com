      <p>
        These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the Travel by B & T website and services. 
        By requesting quotes, making bookings, or otherwise using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Role of Travel by B & T</h2>
      <p>
        Travel by B & T acts as an independent travel agency arranging travel services on your behalf. 
        We are an independent affiliate of <strong>Gateway Travel</strong> and utilize Gateway Travel’s 
        industry relationships, systems, and supplier access where appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not own, operate, or control airlines, cruise lines, hotels, resorts, tour operators, transportation
        companies, or other travel suppliers (“Suppliers”). All travel services are subject to the terms, conditions, 
        and limitations of liability of the respective Suppliers.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Bookings &amp; Payments</h2>
      <p>By booking through Travel by B & T, you agree to:</p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Provide accurate and complete traveler information.</li>
        <li>Review and accept the applicable Supplier terms and conditions before payment.</li>
        <li>Make all required deposits and final payments by the stated deadlines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Failure to make payments on time may result in cancellation of your reservation by the Supplier, 
        subject to their cancellation and refund policies.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Changes, Cancellations &amp; Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        All changes, cancellations, and refund eligibility are governed by the individual Supplier’s policies. 
        This may include airlines, cruise lines, hotels, resorts, tour operators, and other providers of travel services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will assist you in working with Suppliers, but we do not control their decisions, fees, or timelines. 
        Some bookings may be non-refundable or subject to penalties.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Travel Documents &amp; Identification</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for:</p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Ensuring that all travelers have valid passports and required identification.</li>
        <li>Checking visa, entry, transit, and health requirements for all destinations.</li>
        <li>Complying with airline, cruise line, and governmental regulations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Travel by B & T is not liable for denied boarding, entry, or delays related to incomplete, 
        expired, or incorrect travel documents.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Travel Insurance</h2>
      <p>
        We strongly recommend purchasing comprehensive travel insurance that may include coverage for trip 
        cancellation or interruption, medical emergencies, evacuation, baggage loss, and Supplier default.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you decline insurance, you assume full responsibility for any resulting financial loss.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, Travel by B & T and Gateway Travel are not liable for:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Acts or omissions of any Supplier or third party.</li>
        <li>Personal injury, illness, property damage, or death.</li>
        <li>Delays, cancellations, schedule changes, or missed connections.</li>
        <li>Acts of nature, pandemics, weather events, civil unrest, or government actions.</li>
        <li>Additional expenses or losses caused by any of the above.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your sole recourse in such situations is with the applicable Supplier, subject to their terms and conditions.
      </p>
