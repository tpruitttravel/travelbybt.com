              By requesting travel quotes, confirming a reservation, submitting traveler information, or
              making payments through Travel by B &amp; T, you agree to the following Terms &amp; Conditions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="tb-card">

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">1. Who We Are</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Travel by B &amp; T is an independent travel agency and an Independent Affiliate of Gateway Travel.
              We act solely as an agent between you (“the traveler”) and third-party travel suppliers
              (“Suppliers”), including cruise lines, resorts, hotels, airlines, transportation providers,
              tour operators, and other vendors.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">2. Role as Agent</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              When you book travel through us, you are entering into a direct contract with the Supplier(s),
              not with Travel by B &amp; T. All Supplier Terms & Conditions—regarding pricing, payments,
              cancellations, refunds, documentation, and travel conduct—apply in full.
            </p>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Travel by B &amp; T is not responsible for Supplier actions, omissions, policies, or changes.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">3. Quotes, Pricing &amp; Availability</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              All prices, availability, promotions, and schedules are controlled by the Supplier and may change
              at any time prior to payment being fully processed by that Supplier.
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Quotes are not guaranteed until deposit/payment is processed.</li>
              <li>Suppliers may modify pricing due to demand, inventory, taxes, or currency changes.</li>
              <li>Errors in pricing provided by Suppliers are outside our control and may require correction.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">4. Payments &amp; Deposits</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Payment requirements—including deposit amounts, final payment deadlines, and accepted methods—
              are set by the Supplier. Failure to pay on time may result in cancellation or price changes.
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Payments are processed directly through Supplier systems or secure payment links.</li>
              <li>Travel by B &amp; T does not process or store credit card information.</li>
              <li>Late payments may require rebooking at current pricing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">5. Cancellations, Changes &amp; Refunds</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              All cancellation policies, refund rules, and change penalties are determined by the Supplier.
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Some bookings are non-refundable.</li>
              <li>Changes may result in fees or fare differences.</li>
              <li>Refunds, if available, are issued solely by the Supplier—not by Travel by B &amp; T.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We will assist you in submitting requests, but decisions and processing timelines belong to the Supplier.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">6. Traveler Responsibilities</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              You agree to provide accurate traveler information, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Correct legal names matching passports or IDs</li>
              <li>Valid contact information</li>
              <li>Birthdates for all travelers</li>
              <li>Any mobility, medical, or dietary needs</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              You are also responsible for reviewing all invoices, confirmations, and travel documents for accuracy.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">7. Documentation, Passports &amp; ID</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              It is your responsibility to ensure you meet all identification, passport, visa, vaccination,
              and entry requirements for each destination.
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Passports must meet validity requirements for each country.</li>
              <li>Visa requirements vary by destination and nationality.</li>
              <li>Failure to meet documentation requirements may result in denied boarding or entry.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Travel by B &amp; T can offer guidance but cannot guarantee entry or boarding.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">8. Travel Insurance</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Travel insurance is strongly recommended. Without insurance, you assume full financial risk
              of cancellation, interruption, medical emergencies, or unforeseen travel disruptions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">9. Events Beyond Our Control</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Travel by B &amp; T is not responsible for actions or failures of Suppliers or for events outside
              our control, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Weather, natural disasters, or health events</li>
              <li>Supplier schedule changes or cancellations</li>
              <li>Mechanical issues or operational disruptions</li>
              <li>Government actions, civil unrest, or strikes</li>
              <li>Lost luggage or personal property</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">10. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              To the fullest extent permitted by law, Travel by B &amp; T is not liable for:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Injury, loss, accident, delay, or irregularity</li>
              <li>Supplier negligence, errors, or omissions</li>
              <li>Indirect, incidental, or consequential damages</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">11. Accuracy of Information</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We make reasonable efforts to provide accurate information, but final details—pricing, inclusions,
              schedules, policies—are always those issued by the Supplier at the time of booking.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading">12. Governing Law</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
