    <h2>1. Our Role</h2>
    <p>
      Travel by B &amp; T is an independent travel agency and an affiliate of <strong>Gateway Travel</strong>. We act as an
      intermediary between you and travel suppliers, including but not limited to cruise lines, airlines, hotels, resorts,
      tour operators, transportation providers, and insurance companies (“Suppliers”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Your bookings are subject to the terms, conditions, and policies of each Supplier. By confirming a booking, you agree
      to review and accept their terms in addition to ours.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Quotes, Pricing &amp; Availability</h2>
    <p>
      All quotes are based on availability at the time they are provided and are subject to change until deposits or full
      payments are made and confirmed. Pricing, schedules, and availability are controlled by Suppliers and may change
      without notice.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Payments &amp; Deadlines</h2>
    <p>
      Payment schedules and deposit requirements are set by Suppliers. We will communicate key deadlines based on the
      information provided to us. It is your responsibility to ensure payments are made on time. Failure to do so may result in
      cancellation, loss of deposits, or change fees.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Client Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for:</p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>Reviewing all confirmations, invoices, and travel documents for accuracy</li>
      <li>Providing correct legal names, dates of birth, and other information as it appears on government-issued ID</li>
      <li>Meeting all passport, visa, vaccination, and entry requirements for destinations visited</li>
      <li>Complying with all health, safety, and conduct rules of Suppliers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Documentation &amp; Entry Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for securing required travel documents, including passports, visas, and any required health
      documentation. We can provide general guidance, but official requirements are determined by governments and can change
      at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes, Cancellations &amp; Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      Change and cancellation policies are governed by each Supplier’s terms. Fees may apply. Not all bookings are
      refundable. We will assist with change or cancellation requests, but we do not guarantee that fees will be waived or
      that refunds will be issued.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Travel Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      We strongly recommend purchasing travel insurance to help protect against unexpected events, including trip
      cancellation, medical emergencies, and travel delays. Coverage is subject to the terms of the policy issued by the
      insurance provider. It is your responsibility to review and understand the policy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Limitations of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      Travel by B &amp; T and Gateway Travel are not liable for acts, errors, omissions, representations, warranties, breaches,
      or negligence of any Supplier, or for any personal injuries, death, property damage, or other losses or expenses
      resulting therefrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not responsible for delays, schedule changes, or cancellations due to weather, strikes, government actions,
      mechanical issues, or any circumstances beyond our control.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Advisory Notices</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for reviewing travel advisories, health notices, and safety guidance issued by government agencies
      (such as the U.S. Department of State or CDC) for destinations you intend to visit.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Planning Fees</h2>
    <p>
      In some cases, we may charge a non-refundable planning fee for complex or time-intensive itineraries. This will be
      disclosed clearly before any such fee is collected.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms &amp; Conditions from time to time. The “last updated” date below reflects the most recent
      revision. Continued use of our services after any changes indicates acceptance of the updated terms.
    </p>
