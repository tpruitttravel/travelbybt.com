            <p class="tb-section-lead">
              Please review these terms carefully. By booking travel with Travel by B &amp; T, you acknowledge and agree to
              these Terms &amp; Conditions in addition to any terms imposed by travel suppliers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="tb-card">
            <h3 class="tb-subheading">1. Our Role</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Travel by B &amp; T acts as an independent travel agency and as an agent for various cruise lines, tour
              operators, resorts, hotels, airlines, and other travel-related suppliers (“Suppliers”). We do not own,
              operate, or control the services provided by these Suppliers. All bookings are subject to the terms and
              conditions of the applicable Suppliers in addition to these terms.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">2. Supplier Terms &amp; Conditions</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Each Supplier has its own terms and conditions governing your booking, including but not limited to
              payment schedules, change and cancellation policies, documentation requirements, and liability limitations.
              It is your responsibility to review and understand those terms. We can assist with obtaining the relevant
              links or documents upon request.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">3. Accuracy of Information You Provide</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              You are responsible for providing accurate and complete information for all travelers, including full legal
              names (as they appear on government-issued ID or passports), dates of birth, contact information, and
              special requests. Name changes or corrections may incur fees or may not be permitted by Suppliers.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">4. Payments, Cancellations &amp; Refunds</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Payment amounts and due dates are set by the Suppliers. We will communicate known payment schedules, but you
              are ultimately responsible for making payments by the deadlines.
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Deposits and Final Payments:</strong> Deposits and final payments are generally non-refundable
                and subject to Supplier policies.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cancellations:</strong> Any cancellation or change request must be submitted to us as soon as
                possible. All cancellations are subject to the Supplier’s policies and any applicable fees.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Refunds:</strong> If a refund is due, it will be processed by the Supplier according to their
                terms. We are not responsible for Supplier processing times or decisions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">5. Travel Insurance</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We strongly recommend that you consider purchasing travel insurance to help protect your trip investment
              against unexpected events. We can provide information and quotes from insurance providers. Travel insurance
              is optional and subject to the insurance company’s policy terms. You are responsible for reviewing those
              policy documents carefully and for contacting the insurance provider with specific coverage questions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">6. Documentation &amp; Entry Requirements</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              You are responsible for ensuring that all travelers have the required documentation to travel, which may
              include passports, visas, vaccination records, and other entry requirements. Many destinations require your
              passport to be valid for a certain period beyond your travel dates (often six months).
            </p>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We can provide guidance and links to official resources, but you are ultimately responsible for confirming
              requirements with the appropriate government agencies and ensuring compliance before travel.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">7. Changes, Delays &amp; Service Interruptions</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Schedules and services may change due to weather, mechanical issues, operational decisions, government
              actions, or other reasons outside our control. We are not responsible for:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Flight delays, cancellations, or missed connections</li>
              <li>Cruise or tour itinerary changes</li>
              <li>Hotel or resort service interruptions or amenity changes</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We will assist in working with Suppliers to understand your options, but any remedies, refunds, or
              alternate arrangements are determined by the Suppliers according to their policies.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">8. Health, Fitness &amp; Special Needs</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              It is your responsibility to determine whether a trip is appropriate for your health and physical condition.
              You should consult your medical provider for guidance, including any destination-specific health
              considerations. If you have mobility limitations or other special needs, please let us know early in the
              planning process so we can explore options with Suppliers. We cannot guarantee that all requests can be
              accommodated.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              To the fullest extent permitted by law, Travel by B &amp; T is not liable for any loss, injury, damage,
              delay, inconvenience, or expense arising from the acts or omissions of any Supplier or other third party,
              or from events beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul class="tb-list">
              <li>Illness, injury, or death</li>
              <li>Natural disasters or severe weather</li>
              <li>Strikes, lockouts, or labor disputes</li>
              <li>War, terrorism, civil unrest, or government actions</li>
              <li>Theft, loss, or damage to property</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              Our total liability, if any, shall not exceed the amount of commissions and/or planning fees actually
              received by Travel by B &amp; T for the specific booking at issue.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">10. Governing Law</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              These Terms &amp; Conditions are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to
              conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes arising from these terms or your travel arrangements with Travel
              by B &amp; T shall be handled in the appropriate courts located in Virginia, unless otherwise required by
              applicable law.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tb-subheading" style="margin-top:1.3rem;">11. Changes to These Terms</h3>
            <p class="tb-muted">
              We may update these Terms &amp; Conditions from time to time. When we make changes, we will revise the “Last
              Updated” date below. Your continued use of our services after any changes are posted will constitute your
              acceptance of those changes.
            </p>
