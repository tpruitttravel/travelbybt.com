              Travel by B &amp; T is a Ridgeway, Virginia-based travel agency focused on practical, well-planned travel:
              cruises, all-inclusive resorts, Europe itineraries, and group trips — with real support before, during, and after.

                When you book with Travel by B &amp; T, you know exactly who you’re working with — not just a call center

                Our goal is simple: help you pick the right trip at the right time, make the logistics manageable, and be
                available when you have questions. No hype, no pressure, no hidden agendas.
